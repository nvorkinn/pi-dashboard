# Visual Regression Testing

The rendered e-paper screen is tested by comparing it against golden PNGs
checked into `tests/images/`, rather than only asserting on the data that
feeds it. `tests/test_display_snapshots.py` builds each scenario (arrivals,
energy, weather, Spotify now-playing, empty states, etc.) directly from
representative data and renders it through the real `DisplayController`.

## Running it

```bash
pytest tests/test_display_snapshots.py
```

Compares each scenario's render against its golden image in `tests/images/`.
On a mismatch, the test fails with the actual render and a red-highlighted
diff written to `tests/images/_failures/<name>.actual.png` /
`<name>.diff.png` so you can see exactly what changed.

## Updating goldens after an intentional change

```bash
pytest tests/test_display_snapshots.py --update-snapshots
```

This only rewrites the golden images for scenarios whose render actually
changed -- `git status` afterwards shows exactly which ones. Review the new
PNGs, then commit them alongside your code change.

## Reviewing in a PR

Since the goldens are just PNGs committed to the repo, GitHub's own "Files
changed" view renders a visual diff (2-up / swipe / onion-skin) for any
changed image automatically -- no extra tooling needed. The loop is:
change code -> run tests (see what broke) -> `--update-snapshots` if the new
output is correct -> commit the changed PNGs -> open a PR -> review the
image diffs on GitHub -> merge.

## Adding a new scenario

Add a function to `tests/test_display_snapshots.py` that builds the panels
it needs and calls `snapshot.assert_matches("some_name", image)`. Run with
`--update-snapshots` once to create its golden image, review it, and commit
it.
